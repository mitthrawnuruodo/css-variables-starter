# CSS variables assignment

1. Given the starter code here, change some of the CSS properties to CSS variables. Especially look for any repeating declarations, and places where colors are "flipped".

2. Deploy the site to Netlify, and add the URL here: [My Site on Netlify](URL)

Note: The starter code might not be as DRY as it should have been, but that's for the purpose of this assignment.
